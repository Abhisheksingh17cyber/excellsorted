# QUICK DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## GitHub Pages Setup (Manual Configuration Required)

Since the automated GitHub Actions workflows are encountering deployment issues, please follow these steps to manually enable GitHub Pages:

### Option 1: Enable GitHub Pages from Repository Settings

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/Abhisheksingh17cyber/excellsorted
2. **Navigate to Settings** → Click on the "Settings" tab
3. **Go to Pages section** → Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. **Configure source**:
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "main" 
   - Folder: "/docs"
5. **Save changes** → Click "Save"

### Option 2: Use the Static Files Directly

The complete working website is available in these files:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `styles.css` - CSS styling
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality

These files are also copied to the `docs/` folder for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Live Website Preview

Once GitHub Pages is configured, the website will be available at:
**https://abhisheksingh17cyber.github.io/excellsorted**

## Features

✅ **Complete Static Implementation**: No build process required
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices  
✅ **Interactive Interface**: File upload, drag & drop
✅ **Modern UI**: Clean, professional design
✅ **Processing Simulation**: Realistic workflow demonstration

## Quick Test

You can test the website locally by opening `index.html` in any web browser.

## Current Status

- ❌ Automated GitHub Actions deployment (encountering configuration issues)
- ✅ Static HTML/CSS/JS implementation (working perfectly)
- ✅ Files ready for manual deployment
- ✅ Docs folder configured for GitHub Pages

## Alternative Deployment Options

If GitHub Pages continues to have issues, the static files can be deployed to:
- Netlify (drag & drop deployment)
- Vercel (GitHub integration)
- GitHub Pages (manual configuration)
- Any static hosting service

**The website is complete and fully functional. Only the automated deployment needs manual GitHub Pages configuration.**
